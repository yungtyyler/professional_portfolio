# professional_portfolio
A collection of Python based projects to show my progression as a developer.
Most of what I have done so far is text-based apps, or text-based decision games. 
I enjoy creating these text-based games and would love to use pygame in the future to make them more graphically interactive.
I hope you enjoy and I am open to any feedback to help make my code more efficient.
Thank you!
